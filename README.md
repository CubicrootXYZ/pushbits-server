## About

PushBits is a relay server for push notifications.
It enables your services to send notifications via a simple web API, and delivers them to you through various messaging services.

The vision is to have compatibility with [Gotify](https://gotify.net/) on the sending side, while on the receiving side established services are used.
This has the advantages that
- sending plugins written for Gotify (like those for [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) and [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)) as well as
- receiving clients written for the messaging service can be reused.

For now, only the [Matrix protocol](https://matrix.org/) is supported, but support for different services like [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) could be added in the future.
I am myself experimenting with Matrix currently because I like the idea of a federated, synchronized but still end-to-end encrypted protocol.

The idea for this software and most parts of the initial source are heavily inspired by [Gotify](https://gotify.net/).
Many thanks to [jmattheis](https://jmattheis.de/) for his well-structured code.

## Usage

PushBits is meant to be self-hosted.
You are advised to install PushBits behind a reverse proxy and enable TLS.

At the moment, there is no front-end implemented.
New users and applications need to be created via the API.
Details will be made available once the interface is more stable.

To get started, here is a Docker Compose file you can use.
```yaml
version: '2'

services:
    server:
        image: eikendev/pushbits:latest
    	ports:
      	  - 8080:8080
        environment:
			PUSHBITS_DATABASE_DIALECT: 'sqlite3'
			PUSHBITS_ADMIN_MATRIXID: '@your/matrix/username:matrix.org'
			PUSHBITS_ADMIN_PASSWORD: 'your/matrix/password'
			PUSHBITS_MATRIX_USERNAME: 'your/pushbits/username'
			PUSHBITS_MATRIX_PASSWORD: 'your/pushbits/password'
        volumes:
            - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
            - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
            - ./mount/data:/data
```

## Development

PushBits is currently in alpha stage.
The API is neither stable, nor is provided functionality guaranteed to work.
Stay tuned! ðŸ˜‰
